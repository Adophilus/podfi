> ## Inspiration
<p align="justify">
As a content creator, sometimes I get tired of creating contents, this is not because I donâ€™t lack the ideas or the enthusiasm, itâ€™s rather cos I know when I create content most times, I donâ€™t get the right engagements that I would like or the value for my content. I mean, itâ€™s a constant case of content creators struggling to be seen. We post our contents on these platforms, it generates a lot of revenue for them but we donâ€™t get to partake in that or even if we do, itâ€™s only a very small fraction.

Our project, PodFi; a decentralized podcasting ecosystem built on the ethereum sepolia blockchain, was born out of this pain that I experienced as a podcast creator, but thanks to Web3, thanks to decentralization, thanks to transparency, and thanks to inclusivity, I and my team  members; Emmanuel Enebeli and Uche was able to create a product that would help tackle this challenge and make podcasting more desirable and valuable for both the creators as well asÂ theÂ listeners.

);

// Retrieving a podcast by ID
PodcastStorage.Podcast memory podcast = podcastStorage.getById("podcast1");
Tokenomics and Rewards
PodFi uses its native token, PodToken (POD), to incentivize users and facilitate transactions within the ecosystem.

Listener Rewards
Listeners can earn POD tokens through various interactions on the platform:

Listening: Users earn POD tokens based on the number of hours they listen to podcasts. The reward rate is 1 POD per hour.
Liking: Users receive 0.1 POD for each like they give to a podcast.
Commenting: Users earn 0.5 POD for each comment they make on a podcast.
Sharing: Users receive 2 POD for sharing a podcast.
Example
solidity
Copy code
function rewardListener(
    string memory podcastId,
    address listener,
    uint256 hoursListened,
    uint256 likes,
    uint256 comments,
    uint256 shares
) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 totalReward = (hoursListened * rewardRatePerHour) + 
                          (likes * likeReward) + 
                          (comments * commentReward) + 
                          (shares * shareReward);
    PodcastStorage.Podcast memory podcast = podcastStorage.getById(podcastId);
    ERC20Token(podcast.podToken).mint(listener, totalReward);
}

### Tokenized Polls
PodFi allows for decentralized governance through tokenized polls. Users can create and vote on polls, with voting power determined by the number of POD tokens they hold.

### Creating Polls
Only the owner can create new polls.

### Voting
Users vote on polls using their POD tokens, and their voting power is proportional to their token holdings.

Example
solidity
function createPoll(string memory question, string[] memory options) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 pollId = _pollIdCounter.current();
    Poll storage newPoll = polls[pollId];
    newPoll.question = question;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {
        newPoll.options.push(options[i]);
    }
    _pollIdCounter.increment();
    emit PollCreated(pollId, question);
}

function vote(string memory podcastId, uint256 pollId, uint256 option) external {
    require(option < polls[pollId].options.length, "Invalid option");
    require(!polls[pollId].hasVoted[msg.sender], "Already voted");
    PodcastStorage.Podcast memory podcast = podcastStorage.getById(podcastId);
    ERC20Token podToken = ERC20Token(podcast.podToken);
    uint256 voterBalance = podToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(voterBalance > 0, "No voting power");

    polls[pollId].votes[option] += voterBalance;
    polls[pollId].hasVoted[msg.sender] = true;
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, pollId, option, voterBalance);
}
```

### Advertising Integration
Our platform also pushes for advertising through podcasts. Brands can connect with podcasters to advertise their products directly on the PodFi platform. This integration allows brands to:

### Buy PodTokens (POD): Brands must purchase POD tokens to pay fees for advertising activities.
Connect with Podcasters: Brands can easily connect with podcasters to discuss and set up advertising deals.
Incentivize Users: Brands can create incentives or rewards for users who engage with their advertised products.
Example

```solidity
// Brand buying POD tokens for advertising
usdcToken.transferFrom(brandAddress, platformAddress, usdcAmount);
podToken.mint(brandAddress, podAmount);

// Brand setting up a reward for users
rewardListener("podcast1", userAddress, hoursListened, likes, comments, shares);
```
